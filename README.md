# Description

This module adds an extensive audio processing and synthesis toolkit on top of the napaudio module. It allows you to design audio processing patches in Napkin and expand the number of processed audio channels easily. Audio patches can be wrapped in a polyphonic system, so different voices of the same patch can sound simultaneously while independently being manipulated in realtime.

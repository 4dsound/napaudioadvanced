# Description

This module adds an extensive audio processing and synthesis toolkit on top of [NAP's](https://www.napframework.com) napaudio module. It allows you to design audio processing patches in Napkin and expand the number of processed audio channels easily. Audio patches can be wrapped in a polyphonic system, so different voices of the same patch can sound simultaneously while independently being manipulated in realtime.

Make sure to become familiar with [NAP](https://www.napframework.com) before diving into this module!
